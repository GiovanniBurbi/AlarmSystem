# Modelling an Home Alarm System 
Modelling exercise with SysML

# Description
This project consists in modelling a home alarm system.

The work has been done using the modelling language SysML, which extends UML with regards to the software and hardware design of complex systems.

The modelling process includes both structural and behavioural aspects of the system, such as the response of the security company when an intrusion into a house has been detected.
Futhermore, it has been added some arbitrary non-functional constraints.

The objective of this project is to explore the various types of diagrams that SysML defines, so as to create different perspectives from which one can analyse and study a complex system. 

This development process fits within the context of Model-Driven Engineering, which also includes the use of formal methods, such as timed petri nets, to model and analyze non-functional constraints of the system.

The graphic tools used for the creation of the diagrams are Eclipse Papyrus and Visual Paradigm Online.
While Oris 1 has been used to create the petri net.

For more details about the exercise and the process used you can look up the short [report](https://github.com/GiovanniBurbi/AlarmSystem/blob/main/AlarmSistemModellingReport.pdf).
